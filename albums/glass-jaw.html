    <title>Album Review - Fancy That</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>I remember first listening to WELCOME HOME in high school and loving the
        album so so so so much, I'm glad to see Aries releasing again. Unfortunately,
        I had no idea that he released "BELIEVE IN ME, WHO BELIEVES IN YOU" in 2021 so I
        didn't have the chance to listen. I do plan to listen at some point. Anyway, I think that
        this album is pretty good :). Interesing to hear how his style has evolved since 2019.
